In the root directory, we use the following commands:

To build our 3 containers (frontend, backend, and database), where frontend is implemented in Vue.js with the Quasar framework, backend in Node.js, and database is PostgreSQL:

`docker compose build`

Another comand is, when we want to create and start our containers and our application.

`docker compose-up`

Access URLs: 

Frontend: http://localhost:8000/#/ 

Backend: http://localhost:8081/ 

Database PORT: 9999
